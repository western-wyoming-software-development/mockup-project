# Mockup Project
This project is brought to you in collaboration with <a href=https://www.glueops.dev/>GlueOps</a>! One of our industry partners, we reached out to them and asked for their help in designing a project that hits the most important skills of working in GitHub. You will copy this template repo, use a Codespace, make a working branch, edit a Product Requirements Document (PRD), and merge your changes back to the main branch. 

## Instructions
- Find the 'Use this template' button on the GitHub page for this repo, and follow the steps it prompts you with to create your own repository from this template. Name it "Module-14-Mock-Project".

- We can't stop you from cloning the repo and working on it locally, but we highly suggest using the Codespace included with the repo, courtesy of GlueOps. It's a smoothly configured Linux container that includes a fantastic HTML previewer extension and a good-looking terminal, amongst other handy features. Using containerized images of developer environments solves the "it works on my machine" problem and is massively becoming the norm in industry. Getting into the Codespace is as easy as clicking on the 'Codespaces' tab in the window that pops up after hitting the '<> Code' button on the GitHub page.

- Create a working branch by running the `git checkout -b your_branch_name` command in the terminal. The `-b` option makes a new branch, so this command creates a new branch and checks it out. You can name your branch 'update' or 'working', or whatever you like. Just don't complete the assignment on the main branch. You should be committing your progress to the working branch, and at the end of the assignment you will merge with the main branch. We also highly suggest using the git commands in the terminal, even though there are much easier ways to make branches on the GitHub website, because using the terminal is a skill that will make your life tremendously easier in the long run of your software development career.

- `git branch -av` lists all branches, local and remote, if you want to see what branches you have. `git status` is another handy command that shows a lot of usefull information about your commits and branch status.

- Now, you should be ready to edit the PRD. Have fun with this! It's not the crux of this assignment.
  1) Make some changes to the styling of the document so that it feels more like your own.
  2) Add an 8th section called "User Training", and have three points that go over the requirements of an ethical user training methodology. Put this section somewhere in the middle of the document, where the flow would make sense. 
  3) Add a 9th section Called Maintenance and Upgrades at the end of the document. Have at least three points.

- After you complete your PRD and make your final commit, merge the working branch into the main branch. First, checkout main. Then, run `git merge your_branches_name`. This should work without a hitch, but read the terminal's output if anything goes wrong! Merging branches can get tricky really fast, and you will want to be careful you don't overwrite anything important. 

- Finally, Replace the instructions in this README with your name and date of submission, as well as a quick overview of what and where your changes made to the PRD are. This final commit on the main branch will be how we know when you finished your assignment. Remember to submit the assignment on Canvas with a message to let us know you are ready for your project to be graded.
